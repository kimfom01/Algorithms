# Algorithms

I love algorithms and I want to use this repo to track my learning journey.

List of algorithms so far:

1. Searching Algorithms  
   * Linear Search
   * Binary Search

2. Sorting Algorithms  
   * Bubble Sort
   * Selection Sort
   * Insertion Sort
   * QuickSort

## How to build
First you need to make sure you have .NET 6 installed. If you do not have it then [install .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

To build the library run these commands from the CLI in the `~/Algorithms/Algorithms` directory of the project:
```
dotnet build
```
To run tests from the CLI navigate to the directory `~/Algorithms/Algorithms.Tests` and run these commands:
```
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

From time to time I will visit this repo and update with any new algorithms I learn 

Feel free to walk through the project and do whatever you wish ðŸ˜‰
